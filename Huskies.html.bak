 <h1> HUSKY </h1>
	<h3>Why do I like husky?</h3>
		<p>Huskies are the most handsome dogs ever. They are very playful and agile beings with lots of stamina.
			They are very intelligent as well as very gentle and friendly in nature. 
			One of the reason that I love husky most is because of their killer eyes. </p>

	<h2> Types of huskies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong> Siberian Husky </strong></li>
				<img src="" alt="Husky2">
				<p>The Siberian Husky is an extremely affectionate breed that quickly warms up to and loves all humans. 
					They are frequently just as friendly with other animals. These dogs are smaller than a Malamute and often less fluffy, 
					although it can be easy to confuse the two.</p>

			<li><strong> American Eskimo Dog</strong></li>
				<img src="" alt="Husky3">
				<p> The American Eskimo Dog also has a somewhat deceiving name. They originally come from Germany. 
					Their ancestors are thought to be the Eskimo Dog and the German Spitz. 
					They have pure white fur and look somewhat like a miniaturized version of the Samoyed, although they are an entirely separate breed.</p>
			<li><strong> Alaskan Malamute</strong></li>
				<img src="" alt="Husky4">
				<p>The Malamute is one of the large Husky breeds and weighs between 75 to 100 pounds. 
					They stand slightly taller than the Siberian, at around 23 to 26 inches from their shoulder to the ground. 
					These dogs are also more aggressive toward other animals, but rarely to humans. 
					They can be trained to be a guard dog but will need to be taught to safely express their distrust of strangers.
					The Malamute is a brilliant dog that originates from the region around Alaska. 
					These smart dogs often have a strong-willed personality with a sizeable stubborn streak. 
					They need an owner who will be assertive and has experience handling large and stubborn breeds.</p>

			<li><strong> Samoyed </strong></li>
			<img src="" alt="Husky5">
				<p>The king of the fluffy double coat inherent to the Husky breeds is the Samoyed. 
					They have an especially poofy coat that is full of long, white hairs. 
					They are a breed entirely separate from a Siberian Husky but do look similar to them. 
					The Samoyed typically stands between 19 to 24 inches tall and can weigh between 35 to 65 pounds, 
					although the average is closer to 55 pounds. Samoyeds might be smaller than some of the other Husky dogs, 
					but they were still bred and treasured sled dogs. 
					Their fluffier than fluffy coats give them the capacity to withstand living in minus 60-degree weather. 
					They are friendly, although they can also be territorial if they are not socialized.</p>
